# UniDex-Token
Information Hub related to UniDex's native token. 

Currently we're in the works of our docs site that will have a more user friendly look at what the token can be used for and how.
But in order to  start  off simple here are some functions that UniDex will be used for.

1. 33% of trading fees made through the pool will be used to repurchase UNIDX tokens to be
permanently burned from the supply.

2. 17% will then be used to redistribute back to token holders in ETH. This not only protects
holders because solutions such as staking destroy the price evaluation of a token, but it also
rewards holders long term in passive fees as volume piles up while the supply is constantly
decreasing.

3. Users will need UNIDX tokens to receive a tiered system discount on trading fees done
through the pool. The exact levels arent out yet, as we dont know how much will be bought
during the presale and how much will be burned, but it can be something as simple as what we
have listed below:
- 1000 UNIDX - 0.275%
- 5000 UNIDX - 0.225%
- 10000 UNIDX - 0.20%
- 20000 UNIDX - 0.15%
- 100000 UNIDX - 0.10%
These are just example numbers and will change with the supply to keep the numbers fair. You
can also get a discount through weekly trading volume but they wonâ€™t stack on top of each
other.

4. There are other monitazation methods through the user of UNIDX token such as paying a fee in UNIDX in order to have private transaction or Beta testing of features.
